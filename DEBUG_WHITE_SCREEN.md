# Debug White Screen Issue

## 🔍 White Screen After Clicking Dungeon

A white screen in React Native usually means a JavaScript error crashed the component.

## 🎯 How to Find the Error

```

**Please share what error you see there!**

## 🔧 Common Causes & Quick Fixes

## 📋 What I Need to Help You

**Please check the Metro terminal and share:**

1. **Any RED error messages**
2. **The line number mentioned in the error**
3. **The exact error text**

## 🔍 Likely Issues

Based on the white screen, it's probably one of these:

### **Most Likely: Params Not Passed Correctly**

The navigation might not be passing `dungeonId`, `dungeonName`, `dungeonCategory` correctly.

### **Or: Service Import Issue**

RunService might not be importing correctly (like AuthUtils before).

### **Or: Questions API Call Failing**

The questions fetch might be throwing an unhandled error.
