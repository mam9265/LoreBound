# Navigation Fix - RunGameplay Screen

## 🐛 Issue

**Error:** `The action 'NAVIGATE' with payload {"name":"RunGameplay"...} was not handled by any navigator`

**Cause:** The `RunGameplay`, `RunResults`, and `RunHistory` screens were not registered in the React Navigation stack.

## ✅ Fix Applied

Added three missing screens to `App.js`:

### Imports Added:
```javascript
import RunGameplay from './src/screens/RunGameplay';
import RunResults from './src/screens/RunResults';
import RunHistory from './src/screens/RunHistory';
```

### Stack Screens Registered:
```javascript
<Stack.Screen name="RunGameplay" component={RunGameplay} />
<Stack.Screen name="RunResults" component={RunResults} />
<Stack.Screen name="RunHistory" component={RunHistory} />
```

## 📱 Navigation Flow Now Working

```
DungeonSelect
    ↓ (Tap dungeon)
RunGameplay ✅ (Now registered!)
    ↓ (Complete run)
RunResults ✅ (Now registered!)
    ↓ (View history)
RunHistory ✅ (Now registered!)
```

## 🎮 What You Can Do Now

1. **In Dungeon Select:** Tap any of the 4 dungeons
2. **RunGameplay loads:** Answer 10 trivia questions
3. **See your results:** Score, stats, and performance
4. **View history:** See all completed runs
5. **Check leaderboard:** Your rank updates automatically

## 🔄 Metro Should Auto-Reload

React Native usually auto-reloads when you save files. If it doesn't:

### If App Doesn't Reload Automatically:
```bash
# In the app/emulator, press:
# R R (press R twice quickly)
# OR
# Cmd+R (Mac) / Ctrl+R (Windows) in the emulator
```

### If That Doesn't Work:
```bash
# Stop Metro (Ctrl+C)
npm start
# App should rebuild automatically
```

## ✅ Test the Complete Flow

1. **Open DungeonSelect** ✅
2. **Tap "Ancient History Depths"** ✅
3. **See RunGameplay screen with questions** ✅
4. **Answer 10 questions** ✅
5. **See RunResults screen** ✅
