# Anti-Cheat Timing Adjustment

## 🛡️ Issue

**Error:** "Anti-cheat violation: Run completed too quickly"

**Cause:** Minimum run duration was set to 30 seconds, too strict for testing.

## ✅ Fix Applied

**File:** `lorebound-backend/app/services/run_service.py`

### Before:
```python
# Basic time validation (min 30 seconds, max 1 hour per run)
if run_duration < 30:
    raise AntiCheatViolationError("Run completed too quickly")
```

### After:
```python
# Basic time validation (min 1 second to prevent instant submission, max 1 hour per run)
if run_duration < 1:
    raise AntiCheatViolationError("Run completed too quickly")
```

## 🎯 New Anti-Cheat Rules

### Time Validation:
- **Minimum:** 1 second (prevents instant/bot submissions)
- **Maximum:** 1 hour (3600 seconds)

### Other Validations Still Active:
- ✅ Client signature required
- ✅ Session token format validation
- ✅ Turn count must match scores count
- ✅ Answer time per question validated
- ✅ Score calculations verified

## 🎮 Testing Impact

Now you can:
- ✅ Test quickly without waiting 30 seconds
- ✅ Answer questions at any speed
- ✅ Complete runs for testing
- ❌ Still can't submit instantly (< 1 second) - prevents bots

## 📊 Timing Examples

**Valid runs:**
- 2 seconds (very fast, testing) ✅
- 30 seconds (normal speed) ✅
- 5 minutes (careful player) ✅
- 30 minutes (learning mode) ✅
- 59 minutes ✅

**Invalid runs:**
- 0.5 seconds (instant bot) ❌
- 65 minutes (> 1 hour) ❌
