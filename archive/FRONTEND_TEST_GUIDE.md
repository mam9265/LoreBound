# Frontend Testing Guide - Phase 1 & 2

## üéØ Objective

Test the React Native frontend to ensure:
- It connects to the backend successfully
- Phase 1 (Dungeon Runs) screens work properly
- Phase 2 (Leaderboard) screen displays correctly
- All user interactions function as expected

---

## üìã Pre-Test Checklist

### Backend Must Be Running ‚úÖ
- [x] Docker services are up (from previous test)
- [x] API is accessible at `http://localhost:8000`
- [x] Database has dungeons and questions seeded

### Frontend Requirements
- [ ] Node.js installed (check: `node --version`)
- [ ] React Native environment set up
- [ ] Android Studio (for Android) or Xcode (for iOS)
- [ ] Physical device or emulator/simulator ready

---

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Frontend Testing

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
cd lorebound
npm install
```

**Expected Output:** Dependencies install without errors

### Step 2: Check Configuration

The API configuration should already be correct in `src/config/config.js`:
- **Android Emulator:** Uses `http://10.0.2.2:8000`
- **iOS Simulator:** Uses `http://localhost:8000`
- **Physical Device:** You'll need to update to your computer's IP

To find your IP (if using physical device):

**Windows:**
```powershell
ipconfig
# Look for "IPv4 Address" (usually 192.168.x.x)
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
ifconfig | grep "inet "
```

If you need to update for physical device, edit `lorebound/src/config/config.js` and change the return value in the development section.

### Step 3: Start Metro Bundler

Open a terminal in the `lorebound` directory:

```bash
npm start
```

**Expected Output:**
```
                ######                ######
              ###     ####        ####     ###
            ##          ###    ###          ##
            ##             ####             ##
            ##             ####             ##
            ##           ##    ##           ##
            ##         ###      ###         ##
              ###     ####        ####     ###
                ######                ######

               Welcome to Metro v0.80.x
```

**Keep this terminal running!** It's the JavaScript bundler.

### Step 4: Launch the App

**Option A: Android Emulator**

Open a **new terminal** in `lorebound`:

```bash
npm run android
```

**Option B: iOS Simulator (Mac only)**

```bash
npm run ios
```

**Expected:** App should build and launch on your device/simulator

### Step 5: Initial App Launch

When the app first launches:

1. **If you see AuthScreen:**
   - You need to register or login
   - Use the test account we created: `integrationtest@example.com` / `TestPass123!`
   - Or create a new account

2. **If you see MainMenu:**
   - You're already logged in
   - Great! Continue to testing
