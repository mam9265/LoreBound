# RunGameplay White Screen Fix

## ✅ Issue Resolved

**Problem:** White screen when tapping dungeons  
**Root Cause:** Missing error handling and safety checks in RunGameplay component

## 🔧 Fixes Applied

### 1. **Better Error Handling in initializeRun()**

Added:
- Console logging for debugging
- Array validation for questions response
- Better error messages
- Safety check for empty questions array

### 2. **Safety Checks Before Rendering**

Added three levels of protection:
- Check if `questions` array exists
- Check if `questions.length > 0`
- Check if `currentQuestion` exists

### 3. **Improved Error Messages**

Now shows user-friendly errors instead of crashing:
- "No questions available for this dungeon"
- "Error loading question"
- Specific error messages from API

## 🎮 What Should Happen Now

### **After App Reloads:**

1. **Tap a dungeon** in Dungeon Select
2. **See "Loading Dungeon..." spinner**
3. **Questions load** and gameplay screen appears
4. **Play the game!** Answer 10 questions

### **Console Logs to Check:**

Watch Metro terminal for:
```
Initializing run for dungeon: [UUID]
Run started: {...}
Questions received: 10
```

## 🎯 Expected Flow

## 🐛 If Issues Persist

### **Check Metro Terminal**

Look for these logs:
- `Initializing run for dungeon:` - Run starting
- `Run started:` - Run created successfully
- `Questions received: 10` - Questions loaded

### **Common Issues:**

**"No questions available"**
- Backend might not have questions for that dungeon
- Check: `docker exec lorebound-backend-db-1 psql -U postgres -d lorebound -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM questions;"`
- Should show 13 questions

**Still White Screen**
- Check Metro for RED errors
- Try clearing cache: `npm start -- --reset-cache`

**Questions Don't Load**
- Authentication might have failed
- Try logging out and back in
- Check token hasn't expired
